# Wordle Solving Assistant

This works follow [Jim Hall's post on Solving Wordle using the GNU/Linux
commands](https://opensource.com/article/22/1/word-game-linux-command-line).
It automates the `grep`ing processes and should work with any POSIX shell.

## Install

Either clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gilcot/wsa.git
ln $(pwd)/wsa/wsa.sh ~/bin/wsa.sh
```
or just download the script and make it executable:
```sh
cd ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilcot/wsa/main/wsa.sh
chmod +x wsa.sh
```
In both case, ensure the script is in your path (i.e. `~/bin` here.)

## Usage

The script uses three arguments:

  1. Well placed letters, e.g `BA...` after the second try
  2. Misplaced letters, e.g `..L..` or `A....` after the second or first try
  3. The list of letters that don't exist in the word, e.g `CRES` at first try

When launched without one of the arguments, it swithes to interactively
inputing them.

Before starting, prepare your restricted words list, then put it's path
into the environment variable `WORDLE_LIST` prior. Example:
```sh
grep '^[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]$' /usr/share/dict/words > myguess
WORDLE_LIST=myguess wsa.sh
```
Note that:

  - Your words list should be all lowercaseâ€¦ otherwise use `-i` to make the
    searches case insentive.
  - If this environment variable is empty or unset, the script will go with
    system global dictionary which also contains names with title-case. That
    leads to some strange results that cannot be easely fixed.
  - You may use `-d` to display some internal informations before the results.
  - Results are often shuffled. Use `-s` to sort them alphabetically.

By the same way, you can change the number of propositions displayed with
the environment variable `WORDLE_SHOW`.

Here, with `myguess` having 8497 entries (but without: bailo, bauld and
baulk), the arguments `'ba...' '..l..' 'cresmy'` found out:
```txt
babul
bakal
bakli
banal
```
Have fun.
